# README: Interference Alignment 
First Checkin: 03/24/2018, Yihan Jiang

# Usage: 
(1) ia_out_band_general.py: Interactive alignment for most out-of-band cases from Quan and Sreeram's paper
(2) ia_in_band_general.py:  Interactive alignment for in-band cases from Quan and Sreeram's paper
(3) ia_onepass.py:          Non-interactive alignment, check dof for Brusler and Tse's paper.
 
(4) utils.py:               NN modules

 
# Main Result:
(1) out-band: up-to 6 users with bias/precode. upto 4 without bias/precode. Matches theory.
(2) in-band:  TBD  
(3) onepass:  TBD
 
# TBD:
(1) support time/frequency/MIMO diversity.
(2) deprecate quantization.
